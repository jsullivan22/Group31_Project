Structure:
Create dummy data simulator, add in fake data/noise, different frequencies

If time:
Add in analysis capabilities, pick out data in specific frequency ranges, etc.

+A dummy astrophysical time series data simulator.
Create time series data, fill in with noise and several frequency bands. 

Object oriented approach:
A class of methods for data generation. (specify the frequency band, noise model, distribution, length, sampling frequency, etc.)

Another class, which will host objects containing the simulated data, and properties of the data.
We will have methods to manipulate the data, edit the properties. (trim the time series, high-pass, low-pass filters, identify outliers, unit conversion, etc.)
